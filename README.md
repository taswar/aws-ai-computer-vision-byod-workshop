# Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels - Turkish Flag Detection

With Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can identify the objects and scenes in images that are specific to your business needs. For example, you can find your logo in social media posts, identify your products on store shelves, classify machine parts in an assembly line, distinguish healthy and infected plants, or detect animated characters in videos.

Rekognition Object Detection deals with finding objects within an image. To train your model, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels require bounding boxes to be drawn around objects and the objects should be labeled in your images.

In this lab, we will detect Turkish flag on the Turkish Women Volley Ball team within images using Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels.
